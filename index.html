<p>Wits HPC is a special interest group based at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, dedicated to educating students on the fundamentals of High-Performance Computing (HPC) and fostering a community of future HPC experts.</p>

<p>We bridge the gap between theory and practice, equipping students with real-world HPC experience. Through weekly talks, hands-on hackathons, and technical training sessions, we prepare students for competitive rounds hosted by the Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC) and have recently expanded into international competitions.</p>
<p>At our core, we are a passionate group of engineering and computer science students working alongside lecturers to provide learning opportunities beyond the traditional curriculum. Whether mentoring, researching, competing, or innovating, Wits HPC is committed to pushing the boundaries of HPC education and excellence.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-asc">What is ASC</h1>
<p>The world&rsquo;s largest supercomputing competition, the Asia Supercomputer Community (ASC) Student Supercomputer Challenge, was proposed, and is organised by China (in cooperation with experts and institutions from Japan, Russa, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and others). It began in 2012, with 27 universities, and has grown quickly since. Up until this year, a cumulative 10 000+ undergraduate students from 350+ universities have taken part. The competition itself puts students in a position to tackle industry standard benchmarks, such as <a href="https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/">HPL</a> and <a href="https://hpcg-benchmark.org/">HPCG</a>, as well as optimise cutting edge scientific applications. This year, <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/">Google Deepminds&rsquo;s Alphafold3</a> <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/">(Nobel Prize 2024)</a> inference optimisation, <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">Deepseek-AI&rsquo;s Deepseek R1</a> inference optimisation, Cern&rsquo;s <a href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch/">Geant4</a>, and the development of a RNA m5C site detection pipeline are on the table!</p>
<p>The competition consists of 2 stages; the preliminary stage (which is online, from each team&rsquo;s respective home university), and the final round. WitsHPC is proud to say we were among the top 25 teams in this stage, and have qualified to advance to the final round, which is hosted in China, this year in Xining, at Qinghai University.</p>

<h1 id="meet-the-team">Meet the Team</h1>
<p>From Egoli, the City of Gold, we have Wits HPC, who have earned their place among the 25 finalists of the ASC, standing out from hundreds of teams worldwide.</p>
<p>The team is made up of undergraduate students from the Science and Engineering faculties who have demonstrated their passion and dedication to HPC through facilitating talks, writing papers, and engaging in outreach. Most of the team members have competed in other Student Cluster Competitions, both locally and internationally, and are ready to showcase their skills once again.</p>
<p>Their mentor, Prof. Ling Cheng, joined Wits University in 2010 and has made significant contributions to telecommunications and artificial intelligence. He has supervised over 50 postgraduate students, including 11 PhDs, and served as an associate editor for three journals. His expertise will be invaluable in guiding the team through this competition.</p>
